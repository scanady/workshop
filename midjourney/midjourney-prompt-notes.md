<https://s.mj.run/fTy0un_Ae_E> Design a minimalist logo for an investment company called "Midjourney," incorporating elements of technology and green initiatives. Please consider the following design approach:  Logo shape: Choose a simple geometric shape, such as a square or circle, as the base for the logo. These shapes symbolize stability and a solid foundation.  Investment element: In the center of the logo, design a streamlined upward arrow shape. The upward arrow represents the growth and profit goals of the investment company.  Technology element: In a portion of the arrow shape (e.g., at the bottom or one side), design an abstract circuit board pattern using simple lines. This pattern can consist of interconnected straight lines and curves, representing technology and innovation.  Green element: Design a part of the arrow shape as a simplified plant or tree shape, representing the company's focus on green investments and sustainable development.  Color scheme: Use green to emphasize the green elements, showcasing the company's focus on environmental protection. Additionally, choose gray or dark blue for the arrow shape and technology elements to convey professionalism and modernity.  Company name: Write the name "Midjourney" below the logo using a simple sans-serif font. Select a font color that coordinates with the colors used in the logo.  --v 5

### Camera Distance
- extreme close-up > close-up > medium close-up > upper body > medium shot > medium full shot > full body

### Perspective
- ***front view straight on*** represents the front, but it’s not necessarily perfectly straight on. straight on refers to the horizontal shooting angle, so the background won’t be slanted.
- ***bilateral symmetry*** represents the front view with left and right symmetry, which is more accurate than the front view.
- ***side view*** can be either left or right, randomly chosen.
- ***back view*** and ***from behind*** both represent the back, but back view is closer and usually shows the back.
- ***from above*** overhead shot high angle slightly above all refer to shooting from a high angle towards the subject. overhead shot has a higher angle, and high angle captures a wider background.
- ***from below*** represents a perspective of secretly taking a photo from below (?), and the sky is usually distorted into a cylindrical shape.
- ***wide angle*** causes some barrel distortion in the background, while fisheyes view has a stronger distortion effect. However, fisheyes view is contaminated and we always hold the camera.
- ***macro view*** is used for photographing flowers or small objects.
- ***bird's eye view*** is taken from a high angle, capturing a broad background, but birds might appear.
- ***top down angle*** becomes the perspective of being held by a girl from directly above.
- ***low view angle*** is not very low, and I doubt it has any effect.
- ***selfie*** is when the character extends their hand to take a photo and it shouldn’t be too far away.

### Quality
- ***masterpiece*** - a prompt that produces master-level artworks.
- ***best quality*** - a prompt that ensures the best image quality.
- ***high resolution*** - a prompt that produces high-resolution images.
- ***8k*** - a prompt that generates even higher resolution images than 4K.
- ***HDR*** - a prompt that produces images with a high dynamic range.

### Lighting
- ***bloom*** - makes the original lighting brighter, with a brighter effect on the top of the head and shoulders.
- ***soft lighting*** - a softer lighting source, with light on the face and a bit on the back.
- ***hard lighting*** - direct lighting on the subject, with a more prominent outline of the face.
- ***backlight*** - lighting from behind, causing the image to appear darker with light on the shoulders and hair from behind.
- ***god rays*** - another type of backlight, with light shining down from a higher position, resulting in a particularly bright top of the head.
- ***volumetric lighting*** - like a soft version of backlighting, overall darker with a feeling reminiscent of Resident Evil.
- ***sun light*** - more natural sunlight, with trees in the background also appearing to be in sunlight.
- ***studio light*** - lighting sources on both sides of the face, creating a strong sense of three-dimensionality, like an advertisement photo.
- ***bioluminescent light*** - the subject emits light, like fireflies in the night.

### Shadows
- ***detailed shadows*** - with some shadows appearing on the shoulder and clothes.
- ***intricate tree shadows*** - complex and intertwined tree shadows, making it look more realistic.
- ***ray tracing*** - more light reflections from the environment

### Photo Effects
- ***bokeh, depth of field*** - adding some bokeh and depth of field effects to make the image look like it was taken with a lens with a wide aperture.
- ***film photography***, ***film grain*** - adding film grain to create a vintage film look. However, it may not be very noticeable since there are not many details in the image.
- ***glare*** - adding a little bit of lens flare effect, but it’s not very prominent.

### Wind (with weight control)
- ***wind*** - using the default prompt weight of 1
- ***(wind:0.5)*** - You can enclose a number from 0 to 2 to set the strength of the effect. The smaller the number, the weaker the effect.
- ***(wind:1.5)*** - The larger the number, the stronger the effect.

### Negative Prompts
- ***(worst quality:2.00)*** - We absolutely do not want the worst quality, with a weight of 2.0.
- ***(low quality:2.00)*** - We also absolutely do not want low-quality samples.
- ***(normal quality:2.00)*** - We only want the best quality samples, not even normal ones.
- ***low-res*** - We do not want low-resolution samples either.

 ***Negative prompt*** - (worst quality:2.00), (low quality:2.00), (normal quality:2.00), low-res, easynegative
